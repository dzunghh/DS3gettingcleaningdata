# DS3gettingcleaningdata
This is the work for the Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

# Content
This project comprises:
1. README.md (the current file) explains the content of each file
2. CodeBook.md is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data (an overview is outlined above under the run_analysis.R description)
3. the tidyData.txt is a tidy data set that has the mean and standard deviation for each measurments with the subject ID and the activities performed
4. the tidyDataMean.txt is a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
5. run_analysis.R is a R script that does the following:
  + merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  + extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  + uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  + labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  + creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
